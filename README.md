The main objective behind this application is to classify SMS/Email as spam or not spam using machine learning. With an ever-growing demand to communicate in professional settings such as institutes and workplaces, especially during times when remote communication became essential, the risk of encountering spam has significantly increased.

Unfortunately, this environment also provides fertile ground for spammers who exploit it to execute fraudulent activities. To combat this, our application utilizes Python, a powerful tool for building machine learning models, to help distinguish spam from legitimate messages.
